# Password Generator

## First Javascript Assignment

**Goal:**

My primary goal for this project was to make a working password generator using the skills we learned over this past week. During this project I was also able to practice my debugging skills when certain aspects of the script were missing and apply my new knowledge of basic Javascript to solve the issues that were on the page. This project got me more comforatable with early Javascript fundamentals and will help me be more efficient in my next project.

**Adding Functionality to a Password Generator**

- I was given starter code that had the basic layout html and css already started so that I could add Javascript elements that would make the page functional. I started by seeing what all of the starter code was for so that I could figure out where to begin. Looking through what I had already had, I determined that there was a function being called but not defined so I would need to make it. I also saw that I would need to add all of the possible characters into arrays so that they could be implemented into the password when generated.

- I added the missing elements and from there I used window.promt to create a starting point for the user. I added all of the specified conditions for the user to select and then linked them up to their arrays. I made sure there was a way the input to be validated to ensure everything would work smoothly when user makes choices. I finished by making sure there was a way got the password to be generated based on the chosen criteria.

- I finished by adding descriptive comments in the script file to help organize and condense the page.
